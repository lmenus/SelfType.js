	            <span>It's awkward having a policeman around the house. Friends drop in, a man with a badge answers the door, the temperature drops 20 degrees.</span>
	            <span>You throw a party and that badge gets in the way. All of a sudden there isn't a straight man in the crowd. Everybody's a comedian.</span>
	            <span>"Don't drink too much," somebody says, "or the man with a badge'll run you in." Or "How's it going, Dick Tracy? How many jaywalkers did you pinch today?"</span>
	            <span>And then there's always the one who wants to know how many apples you stole.</span>
	            <span>All at once you lost your first name. You're a cop, a flatfoot, a bull, a dick, John Law. You're the fuzz, the heat; you're poison, you're trouble, you're bad news. They call you everything, but never a policeman.</span>
